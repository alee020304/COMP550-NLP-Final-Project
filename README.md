# COMP550-NLP-Final-Project
Use of linear and non-linear models to perform in comparison to non-linear BERT in sentiment analysis of Kaggle news header dataset; Naive Bayes, Linear SVM, Random Forest, and MLP.

The sentiment analysis experiments performed on the Kaggle financial news dataset revealed BERT to be the best-performing model, followed by linear SVM, emphasizing its strength in high-dimensional spaces.
The full paper highlights other results and discussions, such as the importance of considering factors such as data complexity, interpretability, and resource constraints when choosing a sentiment analysis model, recognizing that the optimal choice may vary based on the specific requirements of the financial sentiment analysis task.
